# Option Pricer

This is an open source module I rewrote and translated from an open source Jupyter notebook to calculate the fair price of stock options so you can know how much you are overpaying or getting a deal.

I took the stock option formula from that notebook which I can no longer find, that I felt most accurately represented the fair price. There are many formulas and versions of those formulas, and this is but one.
